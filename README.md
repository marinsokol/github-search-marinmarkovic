## Installation

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/marinsokol/github-search-marinmarkovic.git <my-project-name>
$ cd <my-project-name>
```

When that's done, install the project dependencies. It is recommended that you use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for deterministic dependency management, but `npm install` will suffice.

```bash
$ yarn  # Install project dependencies (or `npm install`)
```

## Running the Project

```bash
$ yarn development  # Start the development server (or `npm run development`)
```

While developing, you will probably rely mostly on `yarn start`; however, there are additional scripts at your disposal:

| `yarn <script>` | Description                                                                                        |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `start`         | Serves your app at `localhost:3030`                                                                |
| `build`         | Builds the application to ./public/dist                                                            |
| `development`   | Starts develpment server at `localhost:3030`, watches for changes in code and rebuilds your code   |
| `lint`          | [Lints](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/) the project for potential errors                       |
| `lint:fix`      | Lints the project and [fixes all correctable errors](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/usage/cli/) |

## Deployment

Out of the box, this starter kit is deployable by serving the `./public` folder generated by `yarn build`. This project does not concern itself with the details of server-side rendering or API structure. This makes it easy do deploy to service like [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/). If you want to host in on your own server or inside of Docker you need to build using `yarn build`, after that just start express server using `yarn start`
